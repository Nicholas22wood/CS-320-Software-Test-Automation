How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure that the code is functional and secure I would produce multiple tests for my program. The types of test I would run are JUnit test that would test specific scenarios and have specific fails for each scenario. This would allow me to test different areas and make sure that it fails if one section is incorrect. I would also run a dependency test that would check the system for vulnerabilities, this would make sure that all the known issues are identified, and it also provides solutions to the known problems. It may also identify new issues that have occurred as well so the programmer can work around it.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The best way to interpret user needs to get as much detail as possible, creating accurate user stories and providing as much detail as possible is the best way to produce the correct product. I would also have much more evolvement with the user and have recurring meetings to show the progress to make sure to implement any changes if there were any. To incorporate their ideas, I would try to layout it out in programming language and even write a pseudocode that would help me when reviewing it later.

How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach designing software is by first laying out what the users wants and maybe even creating specific files or items such as strings, int, and more. This allows me to visualize how to create the code and gives me a layout, but I would also look at the security side of the code and make sure it won't break if an incorrect parameter is added. I would also design the program with specific test in mind to make sure that I covered all the possible scenarios in my program.
